  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the convergence of iterative stationary
	and Krylov subspace methods for the PageRank linear system, including
	the convergence dependency on teleportation. We demonstrate that
	linear system iterations
	
	converge faster than the simple power method and are less
	
	sensitive to the changes in teleportation.
	
	In order to perform this study we developed a framework
	
	for parallel PageRank computing. We describe the details
	
	of the parallel implementation and provide experimental results obtained
	on a 70-node Beowulf cluster.},
