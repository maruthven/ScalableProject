Feedback from Naga, Inderjit, Joyce on 11/18/2014 about first submission
-- Add more data structure/implementation details.
-- Need comparison with other distributed or multi-core implementations of PageRank (GraphLab, Joyce's).
-- Try on large graphs that don't fit in memory.
-- Implement Joyce's algorithms or perhaps better variants in OpenMP (priority queue may be tricky in OpenMP).
 -- Possibly use data-driven algorithm on each (multi-core) processor.
